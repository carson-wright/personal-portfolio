Heya everybody, sorry about the day late update, I was camping in middle of nowhere Idaho and didn't have access to wifi. Believe it or not, the woods inspired me for a keyboard project that I hope to be able to tell you guys about soon.

Also here are some pretty pictures:

Honestly, I'm literally exhausted cause I just got back and I really want to go to bed, so I'll share more info on projects next week.
