Hey everybody, I know I promised a lot of information this week, and I do have a bunch of news for you, however, I didn't get as much done as I hoped so I apologize.

## KBD2600 News

#### Quotes

I'm basically done with all the manufacturing files, however, I haven't had time to submit the RFQ (Requests For Quotes) to the manufacturers, however I'm hoping to get that done as soon as I have the time.

## Parcel News

#### Interest Check

I had initially announced that the Parcel IC would be coming June 1st. Chances are I won't be able to make that happen so I'll be pushing the launch of the Parcel IC back a month.

## ACP - Acrylic Case Project

I'd like to announce the start of a new venture for me, the Acrylic Case Project. The principle behind the project is to create a series of open source acrylic cases for popular PCBs. I'll be sharing more information about the project in the coming weeks.

## KB Stand

I'm currently working on an open source acrylic keyboard stand. I'll also be sharing more information on this project in the coming weeks.

That's about it for this week, hopefully I'll have a lot of progress made by next week as well as a lot of new info to share with you guys.
