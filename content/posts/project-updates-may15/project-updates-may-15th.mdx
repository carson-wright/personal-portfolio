Hey everybody!

Here's this week's information, I don't have a ton to share this week but here's everything that did happen.

## KBD2600 News

#### Files For Manufacturing

Today I finished the technical drawings for the board which were the last things that needed to be done before I could get quotes. Meaning, I should have quotes from the various manufacturers soon and the prototype will be on its way shortly. 

I look forward to sharing with you guys the chosen manufacturer and hopefully, in a short amount of time, showing off the finished prototype.

#### Geekhack IC

Once the prototype is on its way I'll be working on a Geekhack IC for the board.

## Parcel News

Once the prototype for the KBD2600 is on its way I'll be able to dedicate some more time to Parcel.

Sorry about the short update this week but there hasn't been much going on, hopefully I'll have more to share next week.
