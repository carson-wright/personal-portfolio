Hey everybody, I got new carpet this week so my computer's been out of commission for a few days and I wasn't able to get as much done as I'd hoped, however, I do have one very important piece of information to share.

***

## KBD2600

#### Quotes

THE DESIGN IS DONE [ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰](https://emojipedia.org/party-popper/)[ðŸ¥³](https://emojipedia.org/partying-face/). This week I finally got the files submitted to the machine shop for quotes, which means we should have a prototype in a few weeks and I should be able to share a lot more information about pricing and the vendor for the board in the coming updates.

#### Marketing and Geekhack IC

Now that the design for the board is basically complete, I'll be shifting my focus to creating all the final graphics and marketing materials for the board. Once this is complete I'll add it to the project page on my website, the project-info channel in the Discord, and create a Geekhack IC for it.

#### Color Options

The new vendor and I are looking into expanding the number of color options available for both the board itself and the front/back panels. Although I can't guarantee anything, If you have any colors you'd really like to see, feel free to suggest them in the input channel for the KBD2600.

## Discord

You may have noticed a few changes being made to the Discord which I'm doing in an attempt to better organize it. I expect an influx of new people once the vendor officially announces the project and once I start posting some more project ICs to Geekhack, and I want to be sure that when those new people arrive the Discord is looking good.

That's all for this week, sorry about the short update. I know I promise this every week but, hopefully I'll have more to share after next week.
