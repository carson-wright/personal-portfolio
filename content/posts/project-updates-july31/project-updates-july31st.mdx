Hey Gang, I'm finally back home which means... I'm gonna reveal Meteor!!!!!!

***

## Meteor

#### What is Meteor?

Meteor got started as a 60% ortho board, however, since I want enough copies to sell for this board to be affordable, it's going to be a 60% ortho and normal 60% board with a PCB and Plate combo to support both. I'll release some more renders next week once I have the time to make them, but in the meantime here's some information on the board.

#### Specs

Here are some of the specs for the board:

- Top Mounted
- 60%
- Anodized Aluminum
- Stainless Steel Weight
- Aluminum and Polycarbonate Plate

And here are the supported layouts:

![Normal](./normal.png)

#### What Is The Status Of The Meteor?

The design is almost completely finished and I'll be ordering a prototype as soon as I'm finished with the design.

#### Why Is This Board Skipping Ahead of My Other Boards

For this board I'm going with a local manufacturer, partially as an experiment, but mostly because this board is simple and I'm confident a non-keyboard manufacturer can handle this board.

#### How Can You Buy The Board?

There's gonna be a small private groupbuy to start with, that way I can ensure the quality meets my expectations and if an issue does come up I can afford to resolve said issue. After that I'll start transitioning towards a larger public groupbuy. Once the design for the board is done and I have the prototype in hand I'll start taking people for the private groupbuy, but I'll release more information on that the closer we get to the GB.

And that's about it for this week, as usual, let me know if you guys have any questions. I'm almost always available and always happy to talk.

Carson
