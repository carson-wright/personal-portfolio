Hey gang, I moved into my college dorms this week and I'm still getting setup, hence the day late update. I wanted to take this time to shed a little bit of light on what my keyboard progress will look like during this year as I'll actively be attending school. First of all, the frequency of substantial meaty updates will likely slow down. Starting soon I'll have a lot of stuff going on and I'm just not sure I'll have as much time to dedicate to keyboards. Additionally, I won't be introducing any new projects, just continuing the ones I already have going.

And that pretty much sums it up for this week, as usual thanks for everything guys.

Carson
