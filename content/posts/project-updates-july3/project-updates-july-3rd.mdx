Hey everybody, to all the Americans, happy fourth of July ðŸ—½. Once again, I've been hard at work, mostly on behind the scenes stuff, however I do have a few things I can share.

#### Quotes

Thanks to Covid we're currently dealing with a worldwide aluminum shortage. As a result, the manufacturer is sturggling to find a reasonably priced aluminum supplier. Once he's able to find one we'll be able to order the prototype and start moving towards the group buy.

#### Website

I'm working on the website for the Acrylic Case Project and it should be done soon. Once it's done, you'll be able to access the site for more information on the project.

That's all for this week, sorry about the short update everybody. I have many behind the scenes projects that I hope to share more about as they progress.
