### Here's A Short Blurb About Me

I'm a Boise native who's majoring in computer science at Boise State University (and taking a few design classes too ðŸ˜Š). On the side I enjoy designing keyboards, programming, skiing, running, and generally being outside.

I aim to make products people enjoy using.

### Here's A Longer Blurb About My Journey In Keyboards

I first stumbled across the world of mechanical keyboards in the spring of 2019 while planning my first computer. For months I'd been working a minimum wage job saving up money, and as is often the case when you've invested your own blood, sweat, and tears, I wanted to get the most out of every dollar I'd earned. It took me a while, but eventually I settled on what I thought was the best list of parts I could get within my budget. I had it all figured out. I knew what CPU I was gonna buy, the motherboard I'd put it in, and the graphics card that would be the workhorse of the machine. I knew every detail of my prospective computer and I had every base covered, that is, except for one. I didn't have a keyboard to use it with.

So I did my research, and somewhere along the way I ended up on r/mechanical keyboards, the de facto home of the internet's keyboard community. AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY. I couldn't believe people were willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a keyboard  functionally the same as one a tenth the cost. It just didn't make sense to me. Why spend five hundred dollars on a keyboard that at the end of the day, is just that, a keyboard? Long story short, I decided my fifteen dollar Logitech suited me perfectly well, I closed down Reddit, and vowed never to visit the keyboard community again.

But, as I'm sure you've guessed by now, that vow didn't last very long and I soon found myself sucked down the rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards, and more specifically mechanical keyboard design. Today I spend the majority of my free time designing new and interesting keyboards (among other things) for wonderful people such as yourself to enjoy.
