If you're looking for a bespoke keyboard, I offer commissions for any of my previous designs.

Commissions include the case, plate, PCB, and any other items regularly included with the board. As per usual, you'll' still need to provide your own stabilizers, switches, and keycaps.

If you do commission a board, you'll have the option to choose any materials, finishes, colors, and make any small modifications you'd like. If you're unsure whether your modification qualifies as a small modification, feel free to contact me and I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

Commissions are priced on a case by case basis.
