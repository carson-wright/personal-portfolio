## What Is The Quality Disclosure?

This quality disclosure exists to inform potential buyers about what imperfections are considered acceptable and unacceptable when purchasing a keyboard or other item. Due to the nature of manufacturing, there will always be some errors in a finished product, and while I work to minimize these errors, some are unavoidable. This page exists to outline those unavoidable errors as well as provide customers with recourse in the event something slips through quality control.

> Please note that this policy may vary when buying from vendors rather than through me. If you have any doubts or questions feel free to contact me.

## Acceptable Quality For A-Stock Boards

Any keyboard that is purchased without the explicit label of b-stock should adhere to the following quality standard.

* There should be no visible surface imperfections on the exterior of the case.
* There may be small discolored spots on the inside of the case. These are a result of the hooks that hold the boards in the anodizing bath.
* There may be scratches or other minor surface blemishes on the interior of the case.
* There may be visible machine marks on the inside of the case.
* In general, you shouldn't expect to see any surface imperfections once the board is fully assembled. In the event that you do, see the section titled what to do if your product doesn't meet the quality standard.

## Acceptable Quality For B-Stock Boards

Expect b-stock boards to be held to the same standard as a-stock boards, with the added exception that small surface imperfections may be visible once the keyboard is assembled.

Any boards listed as b-stock will have pictures explicitly showing what imperfections fail to meet the b-stock standard to give potential customers a better idea of what to expect.
