## Item Returns

In order to be eligible for a return, you must have received your order within the last 30 days, the item must be undamaged, and the item must be in the original packaging. To return your item reach out to support and provide proof of purchase.

Group buy items aren't eligible for returns unless the item fails to meet the quality disclosure.

> Please note that this return policy only applies to boards purchased directly through me and listed on my site. Any boards sold as a collaboration with another vendor or designer, and listed elsewhere, are subject to the other store's return policy.

## To Receive a Refund

After your item is returned and inspected you'll receive an email notifying you that your item was successfully received and notifying you whether your refund was approved or denied.

If your refund is approved your credit card or other method of purchase will automatically receive a credit. Please be aware that this may take some time to post.

If your item is returned damaged, missing parts, without original packaging, or after the 30 day window, a partial refund may be granted.

Shipping costs are non-refundable and you will be responsible for the cost of shipping to return your item.

## Exchanges

Products may be exchanged for different variations of the same product if the exchange is within 30 days of the original purchase. Due to the limited nature of my products, there is no guarantee an exchange will be available.

Group buy items aren't eligible for exchanges.

To initiate an exchange reach out to support with proof of purchase.
