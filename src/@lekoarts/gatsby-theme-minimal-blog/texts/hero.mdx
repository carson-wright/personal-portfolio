Hey ðŸ‘‹
</Text>

I'm Carson, and out of the 1.84 billion websites on the internet, you've managed to find mine! Here you'll find information about my projects (including where to purchase the ones that are for sale), weekly status updates, and any documentation relating to my work.

If you want to hang out with me, I stream design/programming work every Saturday at 12:00 PM Pacific Time on [Youtube]() and [Twitch](). You're also more than welcome to come hang out in my [Community Discord Server]() which is a great place to get help, behind the scenes information, and more! If you want play an active role in helping shape my projects, you can [Buy Me A Coffee]() for access to exclusive opportunities to give feedback.

If for any reason you need to contact me, feel free to shoot me an email at `carson@carsonwright.me`, or send me a message on Discord at `Carson Wrong#0001`.
